- **Media Sharing:** Upload and share images in the chat, utilizing **Firebase Storage** for handling media files.
- **State Management:** Efficient state management using **Provider**, ensuring smooth and reactive UI updates.
- **Dependency Injection:** Structured and maintainable codebase with **Get_it** for dependency injection.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter:** The UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile from a single codebase.
- **Firebase Authentication:** For secure and seamless user authentication.
- **Firebase Firestore Database:** A scalable and flexible NoSQL cloud database for storing and syncing chat messages in real-time.
- **Firebase Storage:** For uploading and retrieving media files such as images and videos.
- **Provider:** A state management library that allows you to manage and share state in an efficient way across the app.
- **Get_it:** A simple and flexible dependency injection library to manage instances and dependencies within the app.
